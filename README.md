# UnityStealthGame
Group project. Uploading code I worked on.

Worked on a unity game with a group of other students. Worked on the game for about a month. I primarily worked on the enemy AI. helped out with other systems and other parts of the game as well. 

Helped create the enemy vision, enemy patrol, enemy range attacks.
