# UnityStealthGame
Group project. Uploading code I worked on.

Worked on a unity game with a group of other students. Worked on the game for about a month. I primarily worked on the enemy AI. helped out with other systems and other parts of the game as well. 

Helped create the enemy vision, enemy patrol, enemy range attacks. 

To see the rest of the game visit gvtalavera.com

Still have the full game saved however don't know about pushing other's code or even a full Unity game on github either.
